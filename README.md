# MoneyOrganiser :south_africa:
A program that organises your amount to different notes and coins of the South African Currency.

This is a my own version and South African implementation of the conecpt taken from [CodeMentor](https://www.codementor.io/tips/8382241794/java-money-counter-to-count-the-large-sums-of-money-you-wish-you-had)

You can find more about the South Africa currency on the [South African Reserve Bank](https://www.resbank.co.za/BanknotesandCoin/SouthAfricanCurrency/Pages/South%20African%20currency.aspx) website.

Please let me know if any of the links above get broken.


You can go ahead and execute the application from the root directory without compiling. 

``` 
java -cp bin notesCoins 
```
Or you can compile if you want to (from the root directory), before executing

```
javac -d bin src/notesCoins.java
```
